Next.js continues to evolve, making it a powerful framework for building modern web applications. Version 15 introduces several exciting features and improvements, especially around the App Router and Server Components.

## Setting Up Your Project

Creating a new Next.js app with the latest features is straightforward:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-dev-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

This command sets up a new project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint configured, ready for development.

## Key Concepts for Developers

Understanding these core concepts is crucial for leveraging Next.js effectively:

- **App Router:** The default routing system, enabling features like nested layouts, route groups, and Server Components.
- **Server Components:** Rendered on the server, reducing client-side JavaScript and improving performance. Ideal for data fetching and non-interactive UI.
- **Client Components:** Use the `'use client'` directive. Necessary for interactivity, state management (useState, useEffect), and browser APIs.
- **File-based Routing:** Directory structure defines routes (e.g., `app/dashboard/page.tsx` maps to `/dashboard`).
- **Data Fetching:** Use async Server Components for direct data fetching or leverage Server Actions for mutations.
- **Server Actions:** Functions executed securely on the server, often used for form submissions and data mutations without needing separate API routes.

Next.js provides a robust foundation for building performant, scalable, and maintainable full-stack applications with an excellent developer experience focused on modern web standards.
